/**
 * This module contains the root reducer factory for the Topcoder Community
 * App's state. The factory returns a promise which resolves to the reducer.
 * It accepts ExpressJS HTTP request object as its only optional arguments.
 *
 * In case the argument is provided, the factory assumes server-side rendering,
 * and it can use data available in the HTTP request to preload any necessary
 * data to use as the default state.
 *
 * In case no argument is provided, the factory assumes client-side rendering
 * and should not spend time on creating the default state, as the store will
 * be created with the initial state passed from server anyway.
 *
 * To understand reducers read http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html.
